            The layer will render correctly for ClearType text. If the render target was set
            to ClearType previously, the layer will continue to render ClearType. If the
            render target was set to ClearType and this option is not specified, the render
            target will be set to render gray-scale until the layer is popped. The caller
            can override this default by calling SetTextAntialiasMode while within the
            layer. This flag is slightly slower than the default.
